# PortfolioProjects

These are the various projects that I've completed. Each project has allowed me to practice and improve my skills, and I've learned a lot from each one. Even though there definitely were some struggles, overall I enjoyed the process of working through the problems that came up and trying out different solutions. I hope to continue learning and to apply my knowledge to whatever projects I undertake.

When possible, I've included the corresponding dataset(s). All datasets used are in the public domain per their respective sources.
